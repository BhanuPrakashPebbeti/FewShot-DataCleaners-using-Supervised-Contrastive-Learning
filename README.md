# Supervised Contrastive Approach for Cleaning Dataset
One of the major problems in training a model is dealing with outliers that effects the model from reaching ideal optimums. To avoid effects of such noises and outliers in the data used, we explore an idea of automating the dataset cleaning process, which can be a pre-processing step to yield better results. Inspired from recent development in DL techniques to form better feature spaces that are able to capture essential data features, we propose a supervised contrastive learning mechanism to clean the datasets.
